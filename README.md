# Exim.js

[hellyeah.is/exim](http://hellyeah.is/exim/)

An ultra-lightweight Flux-like architecture for HTML5 apps using Facebook's React library.

## Why

Because, we hate complexity. Redux is very complex. Adding Redux to your app won't solve any problem per se â€” you would need to add tons of Redux plugins.

Exim focuses on three things:

1. Simple actions with unidirectional flow. You cannot change app data from the outside.
2. Easy lifecycle management and optimistic updates. Those are solid requirements for many modern apps.
3. Being a first-class React citizen. Subscribing to a data or calling an action should never be complex.

```javascript
var User = Exim.createStore({
  actions: ['create'],
  create: {
    // Each action can simply be a function, or a "lifecycle" method.
    on: data => {
      // `this` is a current action's context which
      // is cleaned after the execution.
      this.previous = this.get('lastUser');
      // Optimistic set.
      this.set({lastUser: data});
      // Returns promise.
      return request.post('/v1/user', data);
    },
    did: response => {
      console.log('Success! The new user ID:', response.id);
    },
    didNot: () => {
      // Revert the optimistic update.
      this.set({lastUser: this.previous});
    },
    while: isFetching => {
      // Would be called twice: after `on` and before `did`
      // (when the promise is resolved).
      // Let's show a spinner while we're `post`ing stuff in `on`.
      this.set({isFetching: isFetching});
    }
  }
});

// In your view
React.createClass({
  mixins: [User.connect('isFetching')],
  create() {
    User.actions.create({name: 'Jonny Bravo'});
  },
  render() {
    if (this.isFetching) {
      return <div>Showing a spinner is as simple as that.</div>
    } else {
      return <div onClick={this.create}>Let's create something!</div>
    }
  }
});

```
